        Duke was my dog when I was about 15 until I was almost 18.&nbsp;
        I do not remember how we got him, but he made a mark in my family's life.&nbsp;
        He was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Terrier" target="_blank">Scottish Terrier</a>
        or so I learned.&nbsp; I really didn't care much about that, all I care is that I loved him very much.
